## Model Overview

### Purpose


### Agents

Each agent will have a set of three traits and three preferences, which are randomly assigned from 0-100. 
They will also have a number of pursuits they can make per regrouping period.


### Life Cycle

1. Gather info
2. Pursue agents
3. Regroup

#### Gather info

Each agent will calculate three scores with respect to other agents: association value, reciprocity score, and overlap score.

The association value is calculated by taking the euclidean distance of the agent's preferences with the other agents' traits. 

The reciprocity score is the proportion of pursuits between the agent and each other agent that are reciprocated.

The overlap score is a measurement of pursuit similarity (both sent and received) between the agent and each other agent, with respect to third parties.
  It is based on David Pietraszewski's triadic primitives, whereby:
   
     alliance is the correlation between the agent and each other agents' sent pursuits (i.e., how much they pursue the same agents)
     
     generalization is the correlation between the agent and each other agents' received pursuits (i.e., how much they are pursued by the same agents)
     
     displacement is the correlation between the agent's sent pursuits and each other agents' received pursuits (i.e., how much the agents that agent b pursues pursue agent a)
     
     defense is the correlation between the agent's received and each other agents' sent pursuits (i.e., how much the agents that agent a is pursued by are pursued by agent b)

  
These three scores are then formulated to produce a single pursuit score:

  pursuit value = association value + (reciprocity score + overlap score)


#### Pursue agents

Each agent will pursue the agents with the highest pursuit values. 

Sent and received pursuits will be accumulated (and thus used to calculate overlap in the next reassessment period) 

#### Regroup

Agents who have reciprocated pursuits with each other will be considered "grouped" together for that reassessment period.

Then it all begins anew until the max number of reassessment periods has been reached.


### Analysis

For now I'm plotting the number of reciprocated edges over time across all model loops.
But I must think of a better representation... number of groups only tells half the story (bc they still differ in size)

Best thing would be to see if the model loops converge in some other aspect(s)

Also I could compare it to a model that does not include overlap score
